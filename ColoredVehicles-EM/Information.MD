# Build Process

If you clone this git in the Projects they all have their own special Build settings, 

They will output to a folder Called "Builds" in a ready to use Folder Format:

IE: 

`Builds/Mods/CavRnMods/ColoredCore/ColoredCore-EM.dll`

`Builds/Mods/CavRnMods/ColoredCore/Assets/ColoredCore.Unity3d`

`Builds/Mods/CavRnMods/ColoredVehicles/ColoredVehicles-EM.dll`

`Builds/Mods/CavRnMods/ColoredVehicles/Assets/ColoredVehicles.Unity3d`

This also uses The original Unity Files so there are no changes to the unity files, 

**Note** The Special Build Process only works in "Release" Configuration not "Debug"

Version Number for this Mod will have an Appended -EM To it to avoid Confusion

# WILL NOT WORK WITH THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE MOD!

Ensure you don't have any other version of this mod installed as they will not work together and will stop your server from booting!
